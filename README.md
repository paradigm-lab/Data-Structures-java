# Data-Structures-java
The data structures provided by the Java utility package are very powerful and perform a wide range of functions. These data structures consist of the following interface and classes.

    Enumeration
    BitSet
    Vector
    Stack
    Dictionary
    Hashtable
    Properties

Java provided ad hoc classes such as Dictionary, Vector, Stack, and Properties to store and manipulate groups of objects. Although these classes were quite useful, they lacked a central, unifying theme.
